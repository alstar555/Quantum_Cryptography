# Quantum Key Distribution in Quantum Cryptography
This master's project focuses on the implementation and analysis of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols in quantum cryptography. The objectives include the implementation of popular protocols such as BB84 and E91 using the Qiskit framework in order to conduct simulations to evaluate and compare the security, efficiency, and resilience to cyber attacks.
